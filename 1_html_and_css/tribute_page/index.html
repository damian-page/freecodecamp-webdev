          The Commodore 64 is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982
          by Commodore International. It was first computer for many people who
          grow up in 80ties or even early 90ties. It has been listed in the
          Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of
          all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between
          10 and 17 million units.

          Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its
          name from its 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of RAM. With support for
          multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation, the C64
          could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without
          such custom hardware.

          The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the
          1980s. For a substantial period (1983â€“1986), the C64 had between
          30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per
          year, outselling IBM PC compatibles, Apple computers, and the Atari
          8-bit family of computers. Sam Tramiel, a later Atari president and
          the son of Commodore's founder, said in a 1989 interview, "When I was
          at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of
          years." In the UK market, the C64 faced competition from the BBC
          Micro and the ZX Spectrum, but the C64 was still one of the two
          most popular computers in the UK.

          Part of the Commodore 64's success was its sale in regular retail
          stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty
          stores. Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control
          costs, including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology.
          It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in
          bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and
          affordable mass-production. Approximately 10,000 commercial
          software titles have been made for the Commodore 64 including
          development tools, office productivity applications, and video
          games. C64 emulators allow anyone with a modern computer, or a
          compatible video game console, to run these programs today. The C64 is
          also credited with popularizing the computer demoscene and is still
          used today by some computer hobbyists. In 2011, 17 years after it
          was taken off the market, research showed that brand recognition for
          the model was still at 87%.
